#FBI-gun-data-analysis Project 

you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings.
You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. 
Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 

# Project:

For this project, I am working on to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

##### The Goal to Complete the project:
  
  - Answers to the questions
  - Code to solve the problems 
  - Comments when necessarary

# FBI-gun-data-analysis

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. 
Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. 
The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.

##### Another Files in FBI-gun-data-analysis:
- The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.

- The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.

### 

##### Analyze-A-B-Test-Results uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [Jupyter Notebook] or [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [matplotlib] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.
