# FBI-gun-data-analysis Project 

The purpose of this project is to explore the trends of U.S gun purchases with census population data. 

# Project:

##### The Goal to Complete the project:

  - Ask questions
  - Clean FBI-gun data and census data (FBI-data and census-data need to match their data together before merging)
  - Merge both FBI-gun data and census data altogether 
  - Answers the questions
  - Visualize the combined FBI-gun data and census data
  
# FBI-gun-data-analysis

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. 
Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. 
The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.

##### Another Files in FBI-gun-data-analysis:
- The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.

- The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data
point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.

- "Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb" is found in FBI-Project/home/. It is is the file project, written in python and jupyter notebook.

### 

##### Analyze FBI-gun-data-analysis uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [Jupyter Notebook] or [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [matplotlib] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.
